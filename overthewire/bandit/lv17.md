# Title
Bandit Level 17 → Level 18

## Description
There are 2 files in the homedirectory: passwords.old and passwords.new. The password for the next level is in passwords.new and is the only line that has been changed between passwords.old and passwords.new

NOTE: if you have solved this level and see ‘Byebye!’ when trying to log into bandit18, this is related to the next level, bandit19

## Solution
After logging into the server with the password VwOSWtCA7lRKkTfbr2IDh6awj9RNZM5e, `ls ~` shows `passwords.old` and `passwords.new`.
Reading the question and the commands I may need, I found the `diff` command.
`diff passwords.new passwords.old` will reveal the difference on the left and right side (new -> old).
Since I want the new, hga5tuuCLF6fFzUpnagiMN8ssu9LFrdg is the password.
