# Title
Bandit Level 19 â†’ Level 20

## Description
To gain access to the next level, you should use the setuid binary in the homedirectory. Execute it without arguments to find out how to use it. The password for this level can be found in the usual place (/etc/bandit_pass), after you have used the setuid binary.

## Solution
After logging into bandit19 with the password awhqfNnAbc1naukrpqDYcF95h7HoMTrC, `ls ~` reveals `bandit20-do` in the home dir.
Executing this file with `./bandit20-do` will output:
```
Run a command as another user.
  Example: ./bandit20-do id
```
So running `./bandit20-do id` shows me I can use it just like `sudo` or `doas`.
So, just doing `./bandit20-do cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit20` will output:
