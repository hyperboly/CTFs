# Title
Bandit Level 14 â†’ Level 15

## Description
The password for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to port 30000 on localhost.

## Solution
After logging into bandit 14 either from the previous level with the key or the password fGrHPx402xGC7U7rXKDaxiWFTOiF0ENq, `ls ~` shows nothing.
As per the question, I use `nc` to submit the password.
```
nc localhost 30000
fGrHPx402xGC7U7rXKDaxiWFTOiF0ENq
Correct!
