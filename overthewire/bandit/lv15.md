# Title
Bandit Level 15 → Level 16

## Description
The password for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to port 30001 on localhost using SSL encryption.

Helpful note: Getting “HEARTBEATING” and “Read R BLOCK”? Use -ign_eof and read the “CONNECTED COMMANDS” section in the manpage. Next to ‘R’ and ‘Q’, the ‘B’ command also works in this version of that command…

## Solution
Log into bandit 15 with the password jN2kgmIXJ6fShzhT2avhotn4Zcka6tnt.
To connect to an SSL connection, I use the `openssl s_client` command. `openssl s_client -connect localhost:30001` which would reveal all the information about the SSL connection. Just copy paste the password in and the answer is revealed.
