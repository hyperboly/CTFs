# Title
Bandit Level 18

## Description
The password for the next level is stored in a file readme in the homedirectory. Unfortunately, someone has modified .bashrc to log you out when you log in with SSH.

## Route 1
The first option I tried was from this article [Serverfault](https://serverfault.com/a/668310)
`ssh -t bandit18@bandit.labs.overthewire.org bash --norc --noprofile -p 2220`

## Solution
The solution that I found worked better after is
`ssh bandit18@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 "cat ~/readme"`
