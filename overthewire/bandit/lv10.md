# Title
Bandit Level 10

## Description
The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, which contains base64 encoded data

## Solution
After logging into bandit10 with password G7w8LIi6J3kTb8A7j9LgrywtEUlyyp6s, the data.txt is in the ~ dir.

```
$ ls ~
data.txt
```

Cat the file out and it will appear to be base64, which is also given in the question:

```
$ cat data.txt
VGhlIHBhc3N3b3JkIGlzIDZ6UGV6aUxkUjJSS05kTllGTmI2blZDS3pwaGxYSEJNCg==
```

Use the same command but pipe it into `base64 -d` for decoding base64:

```
$ cat data.txt  | base64 -d
The password is 6zPeziLdR2RKNdNYFNb6nVCKzphlXHBM
```

There you go, password is right there.
