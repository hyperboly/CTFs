# Title
Bandit Level 12 → Level 13

## Description
The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, which is a hexdump of a file that has been repeatedly compressed. For this level it may be useful to create a directory under /tmp in which you can work using mkdir. For example: mkdir /tmp/myname123. Then copy the datafile using cp, and rename it using mv (read the manpages!)

## Solution
After logging into bandit12 with password JVNBBFSmZwKKOP0XbFXOoW8chDz5yVRv, `ls ~` will show you `data.txt`.
According to the question, just create a new `/tmp` folder and copy `data.txt` over to the new dir.
```
$ mkdir /tmp/randomname
$ cd /tmp/randomname
$ cp ~/data.txt .
$ ls
data.txt
```
Now a `cat data.txt` command will show that it is a hexdump file in the xxd format.
`man xxd` shows that the option r reverses the operation:
"-r | -revert
              Reverse  operation:  convert
              (or  patch) hexdump into bi‐
              nary.   If  not  writing  to
              stdout,  xxd writes into its
              output file without truncat‐
              ing  it. Use the combination
              -r -p to read plain hexadec‐
              imal dumps without line num‐
              ber information and  without
              a  particular column layout.
              Additional  Whitespace   and
              line-breaks are allowed any‐
              where."
Using this, I tried `xxd -r data.txt` which returns the binary form of the compressed file.
`xxd -r data.txt > data.bin` would convert the file into binary and store it into a file named `data.bin`.
Using `file data.bin` reveals that it's actually a gzip file, s I first changed the name with `mv data.bin data.gz`.
Then, gunzip the file: `gunzip data.gz` which should give you the file `data`.
Running `file data` will reveal that it is a bunny zip file, so just rename and do it again.

``` sh
$ mv data data.bz2
$ bzip2 -d data.bz2 # decompresses the file
$ ls # will reveal the new file and the text file
data data.txt
$ file data

$ mv data data.gz # gzip again...
$ gunzip data.gz
$ ls

$ mv data data.tar

$ mv data6.bin data6.bz2

$ ls

$ file data6 # The name changed from data6.bz2 to data6, probably worth investigating

$ mv data6 data6.tar
$ tar -xvf data6.tar
