# Title
Bandit Level 11 â†’ Level 12

## Description
The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, where all lowercase (a-z) and uppercase (A-Z) letters have been rotated by 13 positions

## Solution
After logging into bandit11 with password 6zPeziLdR2RKNdNYFNb6nVCKzphlXHBM, `ls ~` will show `data.txt`. `cat data.txt` will show that it is indeed ROT13, so I just searched up a ROT13 translator. This would show "The password is JVNBBFSmZwKKOP0XbFXOoW8chDz5yVRv".
