# Title
Bandit Level 16 → Level 17

## Description
The credentials for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to a port on localhost in the range 31000 to 32000. First find out which of these ports have a server listening on them. Then find out which of those speak SSL and which don’t. There is only 1 server that will give the next credentials, the others will simply send back to you whatever you send to it.

## Solution
Log into bandit 16 with the password JQttfApK4SeyHwDlI9SXGR50qclOAil1.
As per the question, scan ports 31000-32000 with nmap while using the SSL cert option.

```bash
$ nmap -sT -sC -p 31000-32000 localhost
Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2023-01-02 08:46 UTC
Nmap scan report for localhost (127.0.0.1)
Host is up (0.00011s latency).

31960/tcp open  unknown

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 2.49 seconds
```

Port 31518 and 31790 has SSL encryption, I tried both to see what happens.

```
$ openssl s_client -connect localhost:31518

$ openssl s_client -connect localhost:31790
```

If you input bandit16's password into port 31518, it will spit that same string back.
Trying the same on port 31790 reveals an RSA key for the next level.
